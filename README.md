### Encroach

Encroach is a simple territory-conquering game originally inspired by a Flash game called [Filler][filler] on the Russian mail provider, Mail.ru. The game is fairly simple but fun, and was a good exercise in some basic algorithms and object-oriented programming.

### Building

The game is implemented in several languages (currently Java and C++), and each can be built from the top-level directory. To build a given implementation, simply type `make` followed by the implementation's name, in all lower-case characters. Alternatively, run `make all` to build all implementations. For example:

    make java
    make c++
    
or:

    make all
